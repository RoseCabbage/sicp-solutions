```racket
#lang sicp
(define (new-if predicate then-clause else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-clause)
        (else else-clause)))
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
      guess
      (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)))
(define (good-enough? guess x)
  (< (abs (- (square guess) x)) 0.0001))
(define (square x)
  (* x x))
(define (improve guess x)
  (/ (+ guess (/ x guess)) 2))
(define (sqrt x)
  (sqrt-iter 1.0 x))
(sqrt 9)
```

It runs out of memory. For `new-if`, since it is only a normal function, whether the predicate is then-clause and else-clause will all be executed. So the program will never end.
